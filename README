Most commands can accept a page range on which to act.  Page numbers are listed as numbers separated by spaces, enclosed in square brackets (also separated by spaces).  Shell options can be used to simplify large ranges.  For example, in bash one may extract annotations specifically from pages 1-9, 13-20, and 22-25 as follows:

$ leela annots [ {1..9} {13..20} {22..25} ] input.pdf

WHY THE NAME
First see how the poppler library got its name:

Leela was for poppler freedom.  Leela was a poppler advocate.  And of course, Leela was the first one to EAT poppler!

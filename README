Leela is a CLI frontend to the poppler-glib library of PDF functions.

At present the only functional behaviors are to extract text annotation, get a page count, and extract PDF metadata (as unparsed XML).  Many functions will be added in the comming weeks.

Leela is the offspring of AnnotExtract.  The later was to solve a very specific problem, but in doing so I recognized the opportunity to make a much more powerful yet simple tool.
